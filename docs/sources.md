# Source Funnels

Trusted sources for moonshot ideas and strategy intel. Quality over quantity.

---

## Filtering Philosophy

Not every idea is worth pursuing. We filter for:

1. **Claude Code Buildable** — Can this be built primarily through AI-assisted coding?
2. **Solo/Small Team Viable** — No ideas requiring large teams, heavy capital, or physical infrastructure
3. **Software-First** — Preference for SaaS, tools, automations, platforms
4. **Speed to Value** — Can we ship an MVP in days/weeks, not months?

---

## Tech Stack Fit

Ideas that translate well to our stack get priority:

| Technology | Strength | Ideal For |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Next.js / React** | Fast frontend, SSR, API routes | Web apps, dashboards, landing pages |
| **Vercel** | Zero-config deployment, edge functions | Anything web-based |
| **Supabase** | Postgres, auth, realtime, storage | Data-heavy apps, user accounts |
| **Firebase** | Auth, Firestore, hosting, functions | Mobile-friendly, realtime apps |
| **Claude Code** | AI-assisted development | Rapid prototyping, complex logic |

**Green flags:**
- Web-based SaaS
- API integrations
- Data processing/transformation
- AI-powered features
- Automation tools
- Chrome extensions
- Slack/Discord bots

**Yellow flags (possible but harder):**
- Mobile apps (React Native possible)
- Hardware integration
- Real-time video/audio
- Heavy ML training (inference OK)

**Red flags (usually skip):**
- Physical products
- Marketplaces (chicken-egg problem)
- Ideas requiring regulatory approval
- Anything needing large upfront capital

### Tier 3: Candidates to Evaluate

Sources worth evaluating for addition. Haven't fully vetted yet.

#### Moonshot Ideas Track

| Source | Why Consider | Content Type |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **[My First Million](https://www.youtube.com/@MyFirstMillionPod)** (Sam Parr, Shaan Puri) | High-energy brainstorms, business breakdowns, "steal this idea" segments | Ideas + Strategy |
| **[Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio)** (@levelsio) | Indie hacker, ships fast, built multiple profitable solo products | Ideas + Process |
| **[Y Combinator](https://www.youtube.com/@ycombinator)** | Startup ideas library, founder advice, "requests for startups" | Ideas + Strategy |
| **[Matt Wolfe](https://www.youtube.com/@maboroshi42)** | AI tools roundups, new product discoveries | Ideas (AI-specific) |

#### Strategy Intel Track

| Source | Why Consider | Content Type |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **[Lenny's Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@LennysPodcast)** (Lenny Rachitsky) | Deep product/growth interviews, tactical frameworks | Strategy (Product) |
| **[Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/)** | AI research translated for practitioners, Wharton professor | Strategy (AI) |
| **[All-In Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@alaborin)** | Macro tech/business trends, VC perspectives | Strategy (Macro) |

#### Why These Specifically

**My First Million** — Sam and Shaan are idea machines. They brainstorm live, often with "I'd build this" specificity. High signal for software opportunities. Warning: some ideas are more hype than substance.

**Pieter Levels** — Solo built Nomad List, Remote OK, Photo AI to millions in revenue. His approach (ship fast, iterate) matches our philosophy. More Twitter/blog than YouTube.

**Lenny's Podcast** — If you're building a product, this is the best source for "how to do it right." Less ideas, more execution strategy. Worth it for existing projects.

**Simon Willison** — Now Tier 2. Technical depth on what's actually possible with LLMs.

**Swyx / Latent Space** — Now Tier 2. AI engineering patterns and agent architecture.

**Ethan Mollick** — Academic rigor applied to AI capabilities. Good for understanding what AI can/can't do, which informs idea viability.

### Not Recommended (And Why)

| Source | Why Skip |
|--------|----------|
| **Gary Vaynerchuk** | Motivational, not tactical. "Hustle" advice, low specificity. |
| **Most "AI News" channels** | Regurgitate press releases. Low original analysis. |
| **Crypto/Web3 focused** | Different ecosystem, distraction from core focus. |
| **Enterprise-focused analysts** | Ideas require resources we don't have. |

---

## Source Evaluation Criteria

When adding new sources, evaluate:

1. **Track record** — Have they built/invested in successful businesses?
2. **Specificity** — Do they give actionable details or vague advice?
3. **Freshness** — Are ideas timely or recycled?
4. **Tech fit** — Do they understand software/AI opportunities?
5. **Signal-to-noise** — Ratio of actionable content to filler?

Score 1-5 on each. Tier 1 sources should average 4+.
