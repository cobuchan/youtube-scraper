# Claude Code for Local SEO — Strategy Intel

**Video:** [How Claude Code Ranked Me FIRST on Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWNFna6fgS8)
**Date:** August 5, 2025
**Signal-to-Noise:** 9/10 — Dense tactical content, minimal fluff

## Core Thesis

Everyone's building SaaS and AI wrappers. The real arbitrage is using Claude Code to dominate **boring local businesses** — competitors have 10-15 year old websites and no AI sophistication. James built a mobile diesel repair site in 4 hours, did months of SEO work, ranked #1-3 on Google, and generated thousands in revenue within 24 hours.

## Key Tactics

### 1. Boring Business Arbitrage
- Local service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, mobile repair) are underserved
- Competitors run ancient websites, use notepads and spreadsheets
- AI-savvy operators can dominate with basic vibe marketing
- "Hedge against AGI" — physical services won't be disrupted by 2030

### 2. Keyword Research (Keep It Simple)
- Ask any LLM: "Here's my website, give me 25-50 keywords to optimize for"
- Don't overthink volume/competition metrics for local markets
- Categorize by intent: emergency, service, problem, location
- Focus on "ready to pull out credit card" keywords first

### 3. Claude Code SEO Audit
- Prompt: *"Go through this website in extreme detail. Ultrathink about this. Use Opus. Find all technical and on-page SEO issues so I can dominate the local market."*
- Claude finds: missing robots.txt, sitemap, schema markup, speed issues
- Just say "fix them" — it handles implementation

### 4. Location/Service Pages Strategy
- Build dedicated pages for EVERY location + service keyword
- Go deep: local landmarks, FAQs, regional context (e.g., NASCAR in Charlotte)
- Competitors have thin pages — your depth wins
- "Supply matches demand" — one page per keyword cluster

### 5. Sub-Agents for Parallel Work
- Launch 3 agents in background while you work:
  - Agent 1: Find content opportunities
  - Agent 2: Analyze competitors
  - Agent 3: Identify technical fixes
- Prompt: *"Launch three sub-agents..."* — that simple

### 6. Page Speed Insights Hack
- Go to Google PageSpeed Insights (free tool)
- Copy/paste errors directly into Claude Code
- It knows exactly what to fix
- Target: 90+ performance, accessibility, SEO scores

### 7. Design Workflow (Avoid AI-Looking Sites)
- Get a designer to create in Figma first
- Use **Anima** plugin to convert Figma → React components
- Claude Code assembles the site from those components
- Result: 95% design-accurate, stands out from vibe-coded sites

### 8. GEO (LLM Optimization)
- Good SEO = Good GEO. No secret sauce.
- Add `llms.txt` to allow LLM crawling
- Same fundamentals: clean tech foundation, meta tags, topical authority, links, reviews
- "The Midwit meme — top of curve knows: just do good SEO"

3. **Build location pages** for every service area (city, suburb, neighborhood)

### Medium Priority
4. **Set up Figma → Anima → Claude Code workflow** for new sites
5. **Create PageSpeed Insights → Claude Code feedback loop**
6. **Add llms.txt** to existing projects

### Lower Priority
7. **Join Vibe Marketer community** for n8n workflows library
8. **Build internal linking** via Claude Code auto-discovery

## Quotable

> "The biggest gap I see with AI is people don't know the questions to ask. That's where vertical expertise comes in."

> "If you need your air conditioner repaired, you're opening Google, finding someone with good reviews, and giving them a call. That's how 99.9% of this stuff works."

> "There's not a huge differentiated GEO strategy hiding from everyone. The trick is: just do good foundational SEO."
