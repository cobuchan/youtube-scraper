# Skill: Transcript to Strategy Intel

Convert a YouTube transcript about marketing, distribution, or growth into actionable strategy intel.

## When to Use

When the video is NOT about building something new, but about:
- Marketing tactics
- Distribution channels
- Growth strategies
- Sales approaches
- Positioning/messaging
- Platform-specific playbooks

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Content Type

Is this:
- **Tactical** — Specific how-to (e.g., "how to run TikTok ads")
- **Strategic** — High-level frameworks (e.g., "how to think about positioning")
- **Trend Analysis** — What's changing in the landscape
- **Case Study** — What worked for someone specific

### Step 2: Extract Key Tactics

Pull out every actionable recommendation. Be specific:
- BAD: "Use social media effectively"
- GOOD: "Use ManyChat to capture leads via DM when users comment a keyword"

### Step 3: Assess Applicability

Which types of projects would benefit from this?
- SaaS? E-commerce? Content businesses? Services?
- B2B? B2C?
- Early stage? Growth stage?

### Step 4: Create Recommendations

Turn tactics into next actions. Format:
- **Tactic**: What the video suggests
- **Application**: How to apply it to our projects
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low based on effort vs. impact
- **Dependencies**: What needs to exist first
